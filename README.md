# NBTTest
A simple program to compare two Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Block Palettes in NBT Format. 

I created this simple java program to use the CloudburstMC/NBT library to compare revisions of the Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Block Palette as it changes with updates. 

Syntax:
`java -jar NBTTest-1.0-SNAPSHOT <path/to/first/palette> <path/to/second/palette>`

It will load and compare the two palettes and then generate a report on if there are missing block states in either palette.
